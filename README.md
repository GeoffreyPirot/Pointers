# Pointers Project

This project demonstrates the use of pointers in Go. It includes examples of functions manipulating variables by their memory address, showcasing the effect of pointers on data modification.

## Features

- **Increment a Value**: Demonstrates incrementing an integer value using a pointer.
- **Swap Two Values**: Swaps the values of two integer variables using pointers.
- **Modify a Person's Age**: Modifies the age of a `Person` struct by using a pointer.

## Project Structure

- `main.go`: The entry point of the program that utilizes functions defined in the `pointers` package.
- `pkg/pointers.go`: Contains the definitions of functions that use pointers.
- `pkg/pointers_test.go`: Unit tests for the functions defined in `pointers.go`.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you need to have Go installed on your machine. This project has been tested with Go version 1.22.5.

## How to Run

To run the main program:

```sh
go run main.go
```
